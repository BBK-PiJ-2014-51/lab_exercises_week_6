/*3 Creating matrices
Create a class Matrix that has a 2-D array of integers as a field. The class should have methods for:
� a constructor method Matrix(int,int) setting the size of the array as two integers (not necessarily the
same). All elements in the matrix should be initialised to 1.
� a method setElement(int,int,int) to modify one element of the array, given its position (the first two
integers) and the new value to be put in that position (the third integer). The method must check that the
indeces are valid before modifying the array to avoid an IndexOutOfBoundsException. If the indeces are
invalid, the method will do nothing and the third argument will be ignored.
� a method setRow(int,String) that modifies one whole row of the array, given its position as an integer and
the list of numbers as a String like �1,2,3�. The method must check that the index is valid and the numbers
are correct (i.e. if the array has three columns, the String contains three numbers). If the index or the String
is invalid, the method will do nothing.
� a method setColumn(int,String) that modifies one whole column of the array, given its position as an
integer and the list of numbers as a String like �1,2,3�. The method must check that the index is valid and
the numbers are correct (i.e. if the array has four rows, the String contains four numbers). If the index or the
String is invalid, the method will do nothing.
� a method toString() that returns the values in the array as a String using square brackets, commas, and
semicolons, e.g. �[1,2,3;4,5,6;3,2,1]�.
� A method prettyPrint() that prints the values of the matrix on screen in a legible format. Hint: you can use
the special character �\t� (backslash-t) to mark a tabulator so that all numbers are placed in the same column
regardless of their size. You can think of a tabulator character as a move-to-the-next-column command when
printing on the screen.
Create a Groovy program that uses all those methods from the Matrix class: creates matrices, modifies its
elements (one-by-one, by rows, and by columns), and prints the matrix on the screeen.
